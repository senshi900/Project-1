# Project 1 - Library Project using Dart


##Introduction:
The Library Management System is a software application designed to simplify and automate various library operations. It serves as an efficient tool for librarians and library staff to manage books, patrons, and other library resources. This system provides a user-friendly interface for both library administrators and patrons to facilitate library-related tasks.
##Usage:

The "Library Project using Dart" is an exciting software application designed to efficiently manage a library's book inventory and streamline user interactions through a Command Line Interface (CLI). This capstone project provides you, as a student, with an excellent opportunity to apply your knowledge and skills in Flutter Development, showcasing your proficiency in Dart programming.

The primary goal of the project is to develop a user-friendly and efficient CLI that caters to both library staff and patrons. With this CLI, users can effortlessly query books, view the number of available copies, add new books to the library, delete books from the inventory, make book purchases, and receive detailed invoices after each purchase. Additionally, the project demands an essential feature - updating the number of book copies after a purchase is made to maintain accurate inventory records.

To begin, you will create a new Dart project, ensuring that the project structure is appropriately organized for a clean and manageable codebase. As you progress, it is crucial to write code that is clear, well-organized, and scalable, adhering to standard coding conventions to enhance code readability. Demonstrating your comprehensive understanding of programming concepts and techniques is essential for a successful outcome.

Your CLI should allow users to search for books by title, author, or category, providing a straightforward and accessible way to retrieve information about the library's collection. Implementing a method to add new books to the library with the appropriate updates to the book count will further enhance the system's usability.

Managing the library's inventory also involves implementing a method to delete books, ensuring smooth handling of cases where a book to be deleted does not exist. Facilitating book purchases through the CLI is another critical aspect, requiring you to decrease the number of book copies according to the books purchased and generate an informative invoice for the user.

As an extra credit opportunity, you can implement features such as displaying all book categories in the library, returning a list of books belonging to a selected category. Additionally, providing a method to count the number of purchased books will further showcase your skills.

The project must be written entirely in the Dart language and fully submitted through GitHub using version control (Git). Remember to create descriptive commits to showcase your progress and follow the provided guidelines for academic integrity.



## Minimum Requirements:

1. **Project Structure**: Create a new Dart project and organize its structure appropriately. Set up the necessary folders, files, and ensure a clean and organized project layout.

2. **Clean Code**: Write clear, well-organized, and scalable code. Use meaningful variable and function names, following standard coding conventions to improve code readability. Well-structured and easily maintainable code is essential.

3. **Applying Concepts**: Demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of programming concepts and techniques. Implement the CLI features with efficiency and correctness.

4. **Query Books**: Develop a simple CLI user interface that allows users to query books and view the number of available copies. Users should be able to search for books by title, author, or category.

5. **Add New Book**: Provide a method to add a new book to the library and update the number of book copies accordingly. Ensure proper error handling for invalid inputs.

6. **Delete Book**: Implement a method to delete a book from the library and update the book count. Handle cases where the book to be deleted does not exist.

7. **Purchase**: Implement the purchase process, allowing users to buy books from the library. Ensure that the number of book copies is decreased according to the books purchased.

8. **Invoice**: Display a detailed invoice after the purchase, showing the books purchased, their prices, and the total cost.

9. **Editing Capability**: Add the ability to modify book data, such as title, author, and price. Users should be able to update book information easily.

## Ideas for Extra Credit:

- **Display all Book Categories**: Provide a method to display a list of all book categories in the library. When a category is selected, return a list of all books belonging to that category.
- **Reporting:** Provide a method to present a report that contains the number of all purchased books from the library, and calculate their amount.
  

## Delivery Requirements:

- **Language**: The project should be written in Dart language.

- **GitHub Submission**:
   - Create a Fork from the exam’s GitHub repository.

# Project 1 - Library Project using Dart


## Introduction:
The Library Management System is a software application designed to simplify and automate various library operations. It serves as an efficient tool for librarians and library staff to manage books, patrons, and other library resources. This system provides a user-friendly interface for both library administrators and patrons to facilitate library-related tasks.
## Usage:
# 1.Add a Book
Run the program, and you'll be prompted to enter book details such as title, author, price, category, and quantity. The book will be added to the inventory.
# 2.View the List of Books:
You can view the list of books in your inventory, which includes details like title, author, price, category, and quantity.

# 3.Search for a Book
You can search for a book in your inventory by entering a title. The program will display details of all matching books.

# 4.Buy a Book
To buy a book, provide the title of the book you want to purchase. The program will check if it's in stock and allow you to specify the quantity to buy.


# 5.Delete a Book
If you want to remove a book from your inventory, you can enter the title of the book you want to delete.

## Code Structure
The program is implemented as a Dart class named Book.
It includes methods for adding books, viewing the list, searching, buying, deleting, and modifying books.
Book details are stored in a list of maps called booksList.
The code also checks for the availability of books when buying and ensures data integrity.
